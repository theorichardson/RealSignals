		<h1>Apple ProRaw</h1>

		<br>

		<p>Apple's new ProRaw photography is a step away from the computational photography we have become accustom to today. ProRaw saves all of the data captured by the camera sensors in iPhone 12 Pro in a raw format for vastly improved control in post production.<br><br>ProRaw is a surprisingly analog medium, though the "Pro" means it can be done automatically by Apple AI.</p>
